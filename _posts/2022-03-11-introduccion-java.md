MINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a computer science professor, and
released in 1987 as a minimal Unix-like operating system targeted at students
and others who wanted to learn operating system principles. Although the
complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms
prevented it from being free software until the licensing changed in April
2000.

Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications
written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further
Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems.
